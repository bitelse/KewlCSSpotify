just git clone this into your themes folder and you should then be able to run the apply.bat file to apply it, also runs an adblocker so you dont get those annoying ads and are still allowed to be broke and enjoy music. The base color is bad but its the default spotify green so I recommend using another color pallete or make your own in the color.ini file.
